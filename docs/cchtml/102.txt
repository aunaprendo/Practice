Your page should have an h1 element with the text Pricing Plans.
Your page should have a div element with the class pricing-container below the h1 element.
The .pricing-container selector should have a display property with the value of flex and a flex-wrap property with the value of wrap.
Within the .pricing-container element, you should have three div elements with the class pricing-card to represent the pricing plans.
One of the .pricing-card elements should have the class basic-plan in addition to the pricing-card class.
One of the .pricing-card elements should have the class pro-plan in addition to the pricing-card class.
One of the .pricing-card elements should have the class premium-plan in addition to the pricing-card class.
Your .basic-plan element should have an h2 element with the text Basic.
Your .basic-plan element should have a p element with the text $9/month.
Your .pro-plan element should have an h2 element with the text Pro.
Your .pro-plan element should have a p element with the text $19/month.
Your .premium-plan element should have an h2 element with the text Premium.
Your .premium-plan element should have a p element with the text $29/month.
Each of your .pricing-card elements should:
Use Flexbox to stack its content in a column and justify the space between the children using space-between.
Set the flex property to 0 0 200px to give it a consistent width and prevent it from growing or shrinking in the layout.
Set the border property to 2px solid black to see how the different cards take up space.
The .basic-plan element should appear first in the layout. You should use the order property for this.
The .pro-plan element should appear second in the layout. You should use the order property and set its flex-grow property to 2 so it takes up more space than the other plans.
The .premium-plan element should come last in the layout. You should use the order property for this.
