		      Squirrels are expert hoarders, but what many don't know is they deliberately fake 
		      burying food to throw off potential thieves. When they feel watched, squirrels 
		      will dig a hole, pretend to drop a nut in, and cover it, leaving the real stash 
		      hidden elsewhere. This clever deception helps protect their winter supply from 
		      birds and other squirrels. They rely heavily on memory and spatial awareness to 
		      find their real caches later. However, many of these hidden nuts are never retrieved, 
		      inadvertently planting new trees.

		      Squirrels can talk to each other using a secret language of tail flicks and vocalizations. 
		      They emit high-pitched warning calls that vary depending on the type of predator nearby, 
		      whether it is a hawk above or a cat below. Their bushy tails also serve as visual signals, 
		      communicating mood or alertness. Some scientists believe squirrels even eavesdrop on birds 
		      and other animals to assess environmental dangers. This secret communication network helps 
		      them survive in both wild and urban areas.

		    <!-- Decorative top secret label -->
		    <div id="top-secret" aria-hidden="true">TOP SECRET</div>
		
		    <p>
		      One surprising secret is that squirrels have excellent problem-solving skills and long-term 
		      memories. They can remember complex routes through mazes and learn how to bypass human 
		      obstacles to reach bird feeders. In fact, some species even recognize individual human faces 
		      and remember whether those people are threats or not. They've also been known to cooperate 
		      in stealing food, especially in parks where humans often feed them. Behind their playful 
		      exterior is a brain hardwired for survival, stealth, and strategy.
