        <p>
          Mark Rober’s viral squirrel obstacle course videos showcase how
          squirrels analyze and adapt to new physical puzzles. They’ll study a
          setup, make repeated attempts, and learn from mistakes.

        <h2 class="text-bold">Cute Squirrels</h2>
        <p>
          Cute squirrels are tiny, bushy-tailed bundles of energy that charm
          people with their playful antics and curious expressions. With bright
          eyes, twitchy noses, and fluffy tails that puff up like pom-poms, they
          scurry around trees and parks, often pausing to nibble on a nut with
          their tiny paws. Whether they’re leaping through the air, peeking out
          from behind branches, or stuffing their cheeks with food, squirrels
          radiate a mix of mischief and sweetness that makes them irresistibly
          endearing to watch.

        <h2 class="text-bold">Baby Squirrels</h2>
        <p>
          Baby squirrels, also known as kits or pups, are born tiny, hairless,
          and blind, completely dependent on their mother for warmth and care. As
          they grow, they quickly develop soft fur, open their eyes around four
          weeks old, and begin to explore the nest. By six to eight weeks, they
          start climbing and nibbling on solid food, showing early signs of the
          agility and curiosity squirrels are known for. With their oversized
          heads, delicate paws, and wobbly movements, baby squirrels are
          especially adorable and fascinating to observe as they learn about the
          world.
