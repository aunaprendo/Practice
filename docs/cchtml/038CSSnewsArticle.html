          In the heart of a quiet autumn forest, a curious squirrel named Nibbles stumbled upon a half-rotten pumpkin left behind by some hikers. The pumpkin, sun-soaked and fermenting, gave off a sweet, tangy aroma that Nibbles couldn’t resist. He nibbled once, then twice, and soon he was feasting like royalty, completely unaware of the boozy effects creeping up on him. Leaves swirled and the world began to tilt; he blinked hard, confused by how wobbly his paws felt. With a tipsy swagger, he tried to scurry up his favorite oak, only to slide back down in a flurry of leaves.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          Determined but dazed, Nibbles made several more attempts, each more graceless than the last, leaving scratch marks and squirrel curses all over the bark. Birds perched above watched in amused silence, occasionally tilting their heads as he flopped onto his back. At one point, he clung to the trunk with all four limbs, meeping dramatically as if the tree itself had betrayed him. Eventually, he gave up and sprawled in the crunchy leaves, hiccuping and staring at the clouds. As the sun dipped low and his buzz began to fade, Nibbles vowed to stick to acorns—at least until the next pumpkin season.
