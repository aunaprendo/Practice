        <p class="first-paragraph">
          One sunny morning, Nutters the squirrel discovered that the Johnsons’ backyard had transformed into a full-on squirrel obstacle course. Instead of boring old trees and bushes, there were ramps, tunnels, swinging ropes, and balancing beams. Before I tell you how he conquered it, let me emphasize: this was no ordinary backyard. Every twist, jump, and climb led to the ultimate prize: the golden stash of acorns at the very end.
        </p>
        <p>
          After days – days – of hopping, slipping, and cartwheeling off the tiniest branches, Nutters tumbled into the sandbox, rolled in the dirt, and when he shook himself off, he had a revelation! A vision! A picture in his fuzzy little head! A picture of victory! This, he realized, was the secret to reaching the acorns: speed, cunning, and a touch of daring squirrel flair!
        </p>
        <p>
          It wasn’t as dramatic as a superhero landing, but it happened while he was practicing his tail spins over a tire swing. The revelation: the entire obstacle course could be conquered one challenge at a time. Instead of trying to dash from start to finish blindly, he would tackle ramps, weave through ropes, and leap across logs, each section teaching him just enough squirrel skill to succeed. (And if a jump didn’t work, he could always peek at the chipmunk next door for a hint.) Over hundreds of jumps and daring swings, Nutters grew nimble, clever, and unstoppable.

        <p>
          No more panicking at the first fallen leaf. No more staring at a tunnel thinking, “How do I get through this?” Just one obstacle at a time, as he built up his acrobatic squirrel skills. There was no sudden leap from novice to master; each nut he collected taught him something new, and repetition helped him remember every twist and turn of the course.
        </p>
        <p>
          The main challenge was turning all the confusing backyard chaos into a step-by-step nut-winning strategy. Each section of the course tested a different skill: balance, timing, courage, and sometimes the ability to outsmart the snoopy dog. Nutters was learning constantly, rather than pausing to just think about it – his paws were always in motion, his tail always twirling.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead of fumbling aimlessly through the yard, Nutters moved smoothly from obstacle to obstacle, nimbly clearing each one with growing confidence. He got into a real flow state, the kind of joyful rhythm that only comes from leaping and swinging with purpose. By the time he reached the golden acorns at the end, he not only had the prize but the thrill of the journey. And the backyard? It had become his playground, his training ground, and his ultimate squirrel adventure.

              <p>
                Nutters first spotted the Johnsons’ backyard—a few sticks and stones—but dreamed of reaching the acorns at the end.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4 class="h4 list-subtitle">V2 - 2015</h4>
              <p>
                He tried his first ramps and twig hurdles, belly-flopping and learning basic jumps, tail flips still optional.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4 class="h4 list-subtitle">V3 - 2015</h4>
              <p>
                Tunnels and swinging ropes appeared. Nutters honed balancing, crawling, and midair twirls, relying less on luck and more on skill.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4 class="h4 list-subtitle">V4 - 2016</h4>
              <p>
                The backyard became a full obstacle course. Each ramp, seesaw, and zip-line taught him daring jumps and how to dodge the snooping dog.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4 class="h4 list-subtitle">V5 - 2017</h4>
              <p>
                Nutters mastered long jumps and rope swings. Half the course could be navigated without even glancing at the ground.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4 class="h4 list-subtitle">V6 - 2018</h4>
              <p>
                After flips, tumbles, and comic missteps, Nutters reached the golden acorns—proof that persistence and whimsy pay off.
