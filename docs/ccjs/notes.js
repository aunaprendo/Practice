User Stories:

You should have an unordered list with three items.
The unordered list should have the class item-list.
The three list items should contain the item name followed by a button element with the class favorite-icon.
The button element should contain the code &#9825; initially to represent an empty heart.
When a button element containing a heart is clicked, you should add a class named filled to the clicked button if it's not already present, and remove it, if it is.
You should have a class selector that targets the filled class and sets some CSS properties.
When a button element containing a heart is clicked, the heart symbol should toggle between &#9825; (empty heart) and &#10084; (filled heart), depending on its current state.
