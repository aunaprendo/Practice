Within your new function, you need to filter the instruments depending on the selected category.

Filter out items from instrumentsArr and make your function return an array containing the instrument objects with the same category of instrumentCategory. If instrumentCategory is equal to all, return the whole instrumentsArr array.

Then, remove the console.log from the callback of your event listener and log the result of calling instrumentCards with the selected option from the dropdown menu as argument so you can test your function selecting different category options.
