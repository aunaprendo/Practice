          <h3> Morning Code, Afternoon Nuts</h3>
          <p>
						This morning I watched a squirrel pause mid-branch, clearly debating whether the Peanut was worth the jump. That tiny moment of focus felt familiar—sometimes you just need to stop, think, and commit before leaping into a new idea.
          </p>
          <p>
						By afternoon, the same squirrel was back, happily burying snacks with zero hesitation. A good reminder that after doing the hard thinking, it’s okay to relax, enjoy small wins, and trust you’ll remember where you put the good stuff.

          <h3>The Art of the Strategic Pause</h3>
          <p>
            A squirrel on the fence line froze today, tail flicking like a loading spinner. Cars passed, leaves rustled, and still it waited—patient, alert, unbothered by the rush around it.
          </p>
          <p>
						When it finally moved, it was swift and certain. A quiet lesson in timing: pausing isn’t hesitation, it’s preparation.

          <h3>Cached for Later</h3>
          <p>I saw a squirrel dig three separate holes for the same Peanut, clearly undecided. Each spot was tested, rejected, and reconsidered like drafts of a half-finished idea.
          </p>
          <p>
            Eventually, it picked one and scampered off, satisfied. Creativity works the same way—sometimes you have to try a few hiding places before the idea feels safe enough to keep.
