          Squirrels are small mammals belonging to the rodent family Sciuridae.
          They are recognized by their bushy tails, sharp claws, and large
          expressive eyes. Squirrel species include tree squirrels, ground
          squirrels, and flying squirrels, found across the world except in
          Antarctica and Australia.
        </p>

        <p>
          They are energetic, clever, and eat mainly nuts, seeds, fruits, and
          occasional insects or small animals. Tree squirrels are especially
          known for storing food for winter. Flying squirrels glide between
          trees using a membrane between their legs. Squirrels also help forests
          by spreading seeds.

        <p>
          Squirrels are omnivores with plant-heavy diets. Their favorite foods
          include nuts, seeds, fruits, and berries. They use strong teeth to
          crack hard shells and often hold food with their paws. Many squirrel
          species store food for the winter.
        </p>

        <p>
          Some squirrels eat insects, eggs, fungi, or roots depending on the
          species and availability. Their smart foraging behavior and memory
          help them locate stored food. Squirrels also contribute to ecosystems
          by dispersing seeds.

          Tree squirrels build dreys made from twigs, moss, and leaves, usually
          high in trees. They may also use tree hollows. Ground squirrels dig
          burrows with tunnels and chambers for nesting and storing food.
        </p>

        <p>
          Squirrel homes provide warmth, protection, and storage. They choose
          locations close to food sources and safe from predators. Urban
          squirrels may nest in attics or sheds, showing their adaptability.

        <p>
          Squirrels are diurnal and most active in early morning and late
          afternoon. Their day includes foraging, climbing, and navigating tree
          branches. They are agile and quick, helping them avoid predators.

        <p>
          They rest in their nests during hot midday hours, groom themselves,
          and stay alert. During fall, they focus heavily on gathering food for
          winter. At night, they sleep safely in their nests.

        <p>
          Squirrels must watch out for predators such as hawks, owls, foxes,
          snakes, and domestic cats. These predators rely on stealth or speed to
          catch squirrels.
        </p>

        <p>
          Other dangers include habitat loss, cars, harsh winters, and humans
          who may view squirrels as pests. Despite this, squirrels are adaptable
          and clever, helping them survive in diverse environments.
