      <p>
        Animated film about Surly, an exiled and selfish squirrel, who—along
        with his rat companion Buddy—discovers a nut store filled with food.
        Surly makes a deal with his former park community, who are struggling
        to survive the winter, offering to help them steal the nuts. However,
        he intends to keep the food for himself. Unknown to the animals, the
        store is a front for a human bank robbery, leading to a chaotic heist
        where Surly must ultimately learn teamwork and loyalty.
