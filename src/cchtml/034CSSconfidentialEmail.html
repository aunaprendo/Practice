      Squirrels are expert hoarders, but what many don't know is they deliberately fake 
      burying food to throw off potential thieves. When they feel watched, squirrels 
      will dig a hole, pretend to drop a nut in, and cover it, leaving the real stash 
      hidden elsewhere. This clever deception helps protect their winter supply from 
      birds and other squirrels. They rely heavily on memory and spatial awareness to 
      find their real caches later. However, many of these hidden nuts are never retrieved, 
      inadvertently planting new trees.

      Squirrels can talk to each other using a secret language of tail flicks and vocalizations. 
      They emit high-pitched warning calls that vary depending on the type of predator nearby, 
      whether it is a hawk above or a cat below. Their bushy tails also serve as visual signals, 
      communicating mood or alertness. Some scientists believe squirrels even eavesdrop on birds 
      and other animals to assess environmental dangers. This secret communication network helps 
      them survive in both wild and urban areas.

      One surprising secret is that squirrels have excellent problem-solving skills and long-term 
      memories. They can remember complex routes through mazes and learn how to bypass human 
      obstacles to reach bird feeders. In fact, some species even recognize individual human faces 
      and remember whether those people are threats or not. They've also been known to cooperate 
      in stealing food, especially in parks where humans often feed them. Behind their playful 
      exterior is a brain hardwired for survival, stealth, and strategy.
