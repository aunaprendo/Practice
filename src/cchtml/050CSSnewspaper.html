      <h2 id="feature-title">The Lost Nut: A Cautionary Tail</h2>
      <p class="author">By: Hazel Nibblesnout</p>
      <p>
        I’ll admit it: I’ve lost it. My nut. The nut. The perfect, glossy acorn
        I spent three days selecting, polishing, and finally burying in what I
        was certain was the most secure patch of soil in the entire forest. I
        remember the moment vividly—the satisfying thud of earth covering
        treasure, the proud twitch of my tail as I marked the spot. But now,
        only days later, I stand in a clearing that looks… exactly like every
        other clearing.<br />
        At first, I tried to stay calm. “It’s fine, Hazel,” I told myself.
        “You’re a professional. You wrote the column on efficient caching!” But
        after the sixth identical mound of leaves and the third judgmental
        glance from a blue jay, I began to spiral. I’ve sniffed every root,
        pawed through every patch of dirt, and interrogated two moles (neither
        helpful).<br />
        They say memory loss is part of the squirrel experience—that we plant
        forests through our forgetfulness. Romantic, isn’t it? But when you’re
        shivering under a half-empty oak, “ecological contribution” doesn’t feel
        quite as comforting.<br />
        Still, I suppose there’s a moral here: maybe some nuts are meant to be
        lost, to grow into something greater than our winter stash. Or maybe I’m
        just trying to make peace with the fact that I’ll be dining on bark soup
        until spring. Either way, dear readers, mark your caches better than I
        did. Your future self will thank you.

      <h3 id="article1-title">Moving On: Drey on the Market</h3>
      <p class="author">By: Chestnut Whiskertail</p>
      <p>
        After three glorious seasons of cozying up in this oak-top drey, I’ve
        decided it’s time to move on. Before rumors spread among the branches,
        let me be the first to tell you: yes, I’m selling my nest. It’s not an
        easy decision—this place has seen me through storms, leaf-falls, and one
        unfortunate run-in with a rather nosy woodpecker—but change is part of
        every squirrel’s journey.<br />
        The drey itself is in excellent condition. Prime location, high enough
        to avoid most predators but low enough for a dramatic leap to the
        neighboring maple. Spacious enough for two squirrels and their acorn
        stash (or three, if you’re the cuddly type). The insulation—crafted from
        premium moss and hand-picked twigs—is still remarkably soft, with just a
        hint of pine-scented nostalgia.<br />
        So why sell? Ever since the oak next door sprouted a new branch with a
        perfect view of the sunrise, I’ve been dreaming of a fresh start.
        Somewhere quieter, perhaps closer to the stream. Maybe even a
        multi-drey property—who knows?<br />
        Serious inquiries only, please. No chipmunks. Payment accepted in
        acorns, hickory nuts, or equivalent barter.<br />
        Until then, I’ll be perched on my branch, reminiscing about seasons
        past—and planning where to build the next chapter of my squirrel-sized
        empire.

      <h3 id="article2-title">My Human: The Nut Distributor of Dreams</h3>
      <p class="author">By: Pip Whistlefur</p>
      <p>
        Dear readers, gather your tails and listen well—for I, Pip Whistlefur,
        have made a discovery that may redefine squirrel civilization as we know
        it. I have found… a human. Not just any human, mind you, but one who
        gives me nuts. Freely. Consistently. Without expectation of barter,
        bribe, or twig-based tax.<br />
        It began innocently enough—a curious rustle near the park bench, a
        cautious glance from behind a shrub. The human sat there, munching on
        something that smelled like paradise roasted in sunlight. Then, in an
        act of unimaginable generosity, they extended a hand and dropped a
        peanut—unshelled!—upon the ground. I hesitated (I’ve seen what seagulls
        do when trust goes wrong), but hunger and curiosity won out. One nibble
        later, I was converted.<br />
        Now each morning, I meet my human benefactor. They arrive with their
        steaming cup of leaf-water (“coffee,” they call it) and a small paper
        bag full of treasures. Sometimes almonds, sometimes hazelnuts, once—oh
        glorious day—a cashew. We’ve developed a rhythm: they talk, I chatter;
        they laugh, I twitch approvingly. A relationship built on mutual
        fascination and snacks.<br />
        Some will call it risky or undignified. But I say this: perhaps
        friendship doesn’t always come from our own kind. Sometimes it comes
        from a creature with strange paws and a kind heart, who looks at a
        scruffy squirrel and thinks, “You deserve a nut today.”<br />
        And really, who am I to argue with that kind of wisdom?

        The Art of Mushroom Jerky: A Forager’s Gourmet Guide
      </h3>
      <p class="author">By: Juniper Quickpaws</p>
      <p>
        As the crisp scent of autumn drifts through the canopy and acorns grow
        scarce, a squirrel must think beyond the nut. While some spend their
        days frantically burying oak offerings, I’ve been dabbling in the finer
        things—namely, mushroom jerky. Yes, dehydrated fungi, seasoned by nature
        and perfected by nimble paws.<br />
        It began when I stumbled upon a patch of plump chanterelles after a
        rainstorm. Their golden caps glowed like buried treasure, and a thought
        struck me: why should humans have all the culinary creativity? With a
        bit of experimentation (and one unfortunate incident involving a
        questionable toadstool), I developed a process any discerning squirrel
        chef can follow.<br />
        <strong>Step one: Selection.</strong> Choose only the finest,
        non-poisonous mushrooms. If unsure, consult an experienced hedgehog—they
        always know.<br />
        <strong>Step two: Preparation.</strong> Slice the caps thinly using your
        incisors (carefully—presentation matters).<br />
        <strong>Step three: Seasoning.</strong> A touch of pine resin, a dusting
        of crushed acorn, and—if you’re feeling fancy—a hint of dew for shine.<br />
        <strong>Step four: Drying.</strong> Spread slices on a sunny rock and
        guard them from curious blue jays. In two days, you’ll have chewy,
        savory morsels perfect for winter nights or impressing a potential
        mate.<br />
        Mushroom jerky may not replace the humble nut, but it’s a bold reminder
        that squirrels are more than gatherers—we’re innovators, gourmands,
        artists of the canopy kitchen.<br />
        Bon appétit, furry friends. And remember: if it glows, don’t eat it.

        Nuts About You: A Squirrel’s Guide to Unexpected Love
      </h2>
      <p class="author">By: Clover Softtail</p>
      <p>
        I wasn’t looking for love. Honestly, who has time? Between gathering
        acorns, dodging hawks, and maintaining a respectable drey, romance
        seemed like something for poets and pigeons. But fate—sneaky, fluttery
        thing that it is—had other plans.<br />
        It started on an ordinary morning. I was mid-leap between branches,
        cheeks full of breakfast, when I spotted him—sleek fur, glossy tail, the
        kind of confident leap that says, “I’ve never missed a branch in my
        life.” He dropped an acorn. I, ever graceful, tripped over my own. Our
        eyes met in mutual embarrassment, and just like that, the world shrank
        to the space between two twigs.<br />
        Since that day, we’ve been inseparable—as inseparable as two fiercely
        independent squirrels can be. We race along branches, stash nuts side by
        side, and share stolen sips from the same puddle after rain. He claims I
        chatter too much; I claim he over-fluffs his tail. Somehow, it works.<br />
        Love, I’ve learned, isn’t the grand swoop of a hawk or the thunder of
        falling acorns. It’s in the small things—the shared warmth in winter,
        the quiet rustle of leaves when you’re both too full of nuts to move,
        the way your heart races at the flash of familiar fur among the
        branches.<br />
        To those who think love is a distraction from survival—perhaps it is.
        But what a glorious distraction. And if you find someone who makes your
        whiskers tingle and your paws fumble your prized acorn… hold onto them
        tighter than your winter stash.
